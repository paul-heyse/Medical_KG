## Why
Current operations lack a unified deployment playbook. Runbooks are ad-hoc, validation is manual, and there is no automated assurance (E2E, load, chaos) to certify releases. These gaps increase deployment risk and slow incident response.

## What Changes
- Author comprehensive operational runbooks covering hot config changes, scaling, index rebuilds, catalog refresh, GPU failure, vLLM downtime, DB/cluster failover, and incident response.
- Build automated verification suites: nightly ingestâ†’briefing E2E flow, load testing profiles, and chaos drills.
- Ship monitoring and alerting assets (Prometheus rules, Grafana dashboards) plus operational metrics catalog.
- Document deployment guide, cost controls, release/readiness checklist, and continuous improvement cadences.
- Provide tooling scripts (e.g., Locust profiles, chaos harness, reporting) and integrate with CI triggers.

## Impact
- **Specs**: Introduces new `deployment-ops` capability requirements for runbooks, verification, load/chaos testing, observability, release gating, and documentation.
- **Code/Docs**: Adds `ops/` automation (scripts, configs), Prometheus/Grafana assets, updated docs under `docs/`, CI hooks.
- **Teams**: Operations and on-call engineers gain standardized procedures, measurable readiness gates, and automated regressions detection.
- **Risks**: Additional maintenance for test data harnesses; mitigated by clear ownership and scheduled reviews.
