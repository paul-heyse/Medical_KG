# Implementation Tasks

## 1. Test Fixtures & Mocks

- [ ] 1.1 Create sample license configurations for each tier (free, basic, pro, enterprise)
- [ ] 1.2 Create sample user/role assignments with varying permissions
- [ ] 1.3 Create sample audit log entries and retention policies
- [ ] 1.4 Create sample RDF graphs and SHACL shapes for validation tests

## 2. License Enforcement Tests

- [ ] 2.1 Test free tier: verify blocked features, redacted content, and usage limits
- [ ] 2.2 Test basic tier: verify partial feature access and content filtering
- [ ] 2.3 Test pro tier: verify expanded access and relaxed limits
- [ ] 2.4 Test enterprise tier: verify full access and no redaction
- [ ] 2.5 Test tier upgrade/downgrade: verify permission changes take effect
- [ ] 2.6 Test feature flag overrides: verify manual feature toggles
- [ ] 2.7 Test license expiration: verify access revocation and grace period

## 3. Retention Policy Tests

- [ ] 3.1 Test policy execution: verify data older than retention period is deleted
- [ ] 3.2 Test anonymization: verify PII is redacted before archival
- [ ] 3.3 Test audit log archival: verify logs are compressed and stored
- [ ] 3.4 Test policy scheduling: verify execution at configured intervals
- [ ] 3.5 Test dry-run mode: verify reporting without deletion
- [ ] 3.6 Test exemption rules: verify protected data is not deleted

## 4. RBAC Tests

- [ ] 4.1 Test role assignment: verify users inherit role permissions
- [ ] 4.2 Test permission checks: verify allowed/denied actions per role
- [ ] 4.3 Test scope enforcement: verify resource-level access control
- [ ] 4.4 Test hierarchical roles: verify inherited permissions from parent roles
- [ ] 4.5 Test role revocation: verify permissions removed immediately
- [ ] 4.6 Test conflicting permissions: verify deny-by-default behavior

## 5. Audit Logging Tests

- [ ] 5.1 Test log entry creation: verify all security-relevant actions are logged
- [ ] 5.2 Test log immutability: verify logs cannot be modified or deleted
- [ ] 5.3 Test log search: verify filtering by user, action, timestamp, resource
- [ ] 5.4 Test log export: verify JSON/CSV export with pagination
- [ ] 5.5 Test log rotation: verify archival of old logs
- [ ] 5.6 Test log integrity: verify cryptographic signatures or hashes

## 6. SHACL Validation Tests

- [ ] 6.1 Test constraint validation: verify violations are detected and reported
- [ ] 6.2 Test custom shape loading: verify external SHACL files are loaded
- [ ] 6.3 Test validation reports: verify detailed error messages with paths
- [ ] 6.4 Test validation on write: verify invalid data is rejected before commit
- [ ] 6.5 Test shape composition: verify complex constraints with multiple shapes

## 7. Provenance Tracking Tests

- [ ] 7.1 Test lineage tracking: verify entity origin and transformation history
- [ ] 7.2 Test attribution: verify agent/activity associations
- [ ] 7.3 Test PROV-O serialization: verify RDF output conforms to spec
- [ ] 7.4 Test provenance queries: verify traversal of lineage graphs
- [ ] 7.5 Test provenance visualization: verify graph export for tools

## 8. Property-Based Tests

- [ ] 8.1 Use `hypothesis` to generate license configurations and verify consistency
- [ ] 8.2 Use `hypothesis` to generate role hierarchies and verify permission inheritance
- [ ] 8.3 Use `hypothesis` to generate retention policies and verify safe execution

## 9. Coverage & Validation

- [ ] 9.1 Run `pytest tests/security/ --cov=src/Medical_KG/security --cov-report=term-missing`
- [ ] 9.2 Verify 100% coverage for all security modules
- [ ] 9.3 Ensure no test data leaks into logs or storage
- [ ] 9.4 Document security test patterns in `tests/security/README.md`
