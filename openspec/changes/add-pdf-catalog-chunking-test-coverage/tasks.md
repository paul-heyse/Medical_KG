- [ ] 5.3 Test SNOMED loader: verify concept hierarchy, relationships, descriptions
- [ ] 5.4 Test crosswalk creation: verify linking concepts across vocabularies
- [ ] 5.5 Test incremental loading: verify updating existing catalog without full reload
- [ ] 5.6 Test error handling: verify malformed files are rejected with clear errors

## 6. License Policy Tests

- [x] 6.1 Test free tier: verify only public domain concepts are loaded
- [ ] 6.2 Test pro tier: verify licensed vocabularies (e.g., SNOMED) are included
- [x] 6.3 Test loader skipping: verify loaders are skipped when license is insufficient
- [ ] 6.4 Test policy updates: verify catalog is rebuilt when license tier changes

## 7. Concept Graph Writer Tests

- [ ] 7.1 Test concept node creation: verify CUI, name, vocabulary, semantic type
- [ ] 7.2 Test crosswalk relationship creation: verify links between equivalent concepts
- [ ] 7.3 Test hierarchy relationships: verify IS_A, PART_OF relationships
- [ ] 7.4 Test batch operations: verify efficient bulk loading
- [ ] 7.5 Test constraint enforcement: verify duplicate CUIs are rejected

## 8. Concept Index Manager Tests

- [ ] 8.1 Test OpenSearch indexing: verify concepts are indexed with text, embeddings, metadata
- [ ] 8.2 Test search functionality: verify fuzzy search, exact match, and synonym expansion
- [ ] 8.3 Test filtering: verify filtering by vocabulary, semantic type
- [ ] 8.4 Test ranking: verify search results are ranked by relevance
- [ ] 8.5 Test index updates: verify incremental updates without full reindex

## 9. Chunking Pipeline Tests

- [x] 9.1 Test semantic chunking: verify chunks respect sentence/paragraph boundaries
- [ ] 9.2 Test configurable profiles: verify small/medium/large chunk sizes
- [ ] 9.3 Test chunk ID stability: verify deterministic IDs based on content hash
- [x] 9.4 Test metadata propagation: verify document ID, section, page number in chunks
- [x] 9.5 Test multi-granularity indexing: verify parent-child chunk relationships
- [ ] 9.6 Test error handling: verify empty documents or oversized chunks are handled

## 10. Neighbor Merging Tests

- [ ] 10.1 Test similarity threshold: verify chunks below threshold are not merged
- [ ] 10.2 Test merge constraints: verify max chunk size is respected
- [ ] 10.3 Test merge order: verify merging proceeds left-to-right
- [ ] 10.4 Test edge cases: verify single-sentence chunks, very similar adjacent chunks

## 11. Guardrails Tests

- [x] 11.1 Test list item grouping: verify numbered/bulleted lists stay together
- [ ] 11.2 Test table preservation: verify tables are not split across chunks
- [ ] 11.3 Test code block handling: verify code blocks are preserved intact
- [ ] 11.4 Test section boundaries: verify chunks respect section headers
- [ ] 11.5 Test quote preservation: verify block quotes are not split

## 12. Coverage & Validation

- [ ] 12.1 Run `pytest tests/pdf/ tests/catalog/ tests/chunking/ --cov=src/Medical_KG/pdf --cov=src/Medical_KG/catalog --cov=src/Medical_KG/chunking --cov-report=term-missing`
