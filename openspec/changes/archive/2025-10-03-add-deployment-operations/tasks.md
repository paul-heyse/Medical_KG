# Implementation Tasks

## 1. Operational Runbooks
- [x] 1.1 Hot config change procedure (JWT auth, /admin/reload, metrics validation)
- [x] 1.2 Retrieval scaling playbook (HPA, KEDA, manual scale, rollback)
- [x] 1.3 Index rebuild playbook (dual-write, parity checks, alias flip)
- [x] 1.4 Catalog refresh runbook (license checks, diffing, reindex)
- [x] 1.5 GPU/vLLM failure recovery (cordon/drain, restart, verification)
- [x] 1.6 Data store failover runbooks (Neo4j, OpenSearch, backups)
- [x] 1.7 Incident response handbook (severity matrix, escalation, post-mortems)

## 2. Verification & Testing Harnesses
- [x] 2.1 E2E ingestâ†’briefing workflow (fixtures, assertions, latency budget)
- [x] 2.2 Automated nightly execution & reporting (CI or scheduler)
- [x] 2.3 Schema/SHACL validation gates for KG writes
- [x] 2.4 API contract smoke tests (auth, error envelopes, rate limit headers)

## 3. Load & Performance Testing
- [x] 3.1 Locust profiles for burst/steady workloads (intent mix, SLO assertions)
- [x] 3.2 Performance budgeting (P50/P95/P99, throughput, resource targets)
- [x] 3.3 Reporting pipeline (HTML artifacts, Grafana overlays)

## 4. Chaos & Resilience Drills
- [x] 4.1 Chaos harness (pod kill, network partition, disk pressure, GPU OOM)
- [x] 4.2 Automated verification steps post-chaos (health checks, alerting)
- [x] 4.3 Scheduling & guardrails (staging only, approvals)

## 5. Observability Enhancements
- [x] 5.1 Prometheus alert rules (latency, errors, cluster health)
- [x] 5.2 Grafana dashboards (pipeline throughput, GPU utilization, queue depth)
- [x] 5.3 OpenTelemetry tracing coverage (external calls, ID propagation)
- [x] 5.4 Structured logging schema & sampling strategy

## 6. Release Management
- [x] 6.1 Release readiness checklist (metrics, licenses, backups, rollback)
- [x] 6.2 Idempotent deployment pipeline steps (terraform, helm, migrations)
- [x] 6.3 Sign-off workflow (eng, ops, domain approvals)

## 7. Cost & Capacity Controls
- [x] 7.1 Data retention/TTL policies (Kafka, object storage, logs)
- [x] 7.2 OpenSearch ILM tiers & sizing guidance
- [x] 7.3 GPU/compute cost optimization (spot usage, auto-shutdown)

## 8. Documentation & Knowledge Sharing
- [x] 8.1 Deployment guide (prereqs, bootstrap, validation)
- [x] 8.2 Operations manual (runbooks index, contact tree)
- [x] 8.3 Continuous improvement cadence (weekly metrics, quarterly DR drill)
