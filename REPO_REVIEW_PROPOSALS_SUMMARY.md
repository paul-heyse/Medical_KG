# Repository Review - Change Proposals Summary

**Date**: 2025-10-03
**Source**: `docs/repo_review.md` recommendations
**Proposals Created**: 4

## Overview

I've analyzed the recommendations in `docs/repo_review.md` and created 4 focused OpenSpec change proposals prioritized by impact and effort. All proposals have been validated with `openspec validate --strict`.

## ✅ Created Proposals

### 1. fix-ruff-config-defensive-formatting (Quick Wins)

**Priority**: High
**Effort**: Low (~2-3 hours)
**Validation**: ✅ Valid

**What**: Bundle of two quick fixes with immediate benefits

- Modernize Ruff configuration (remove deprecation warnings)
- Add defensive guards to BriefingFormatter (prevent KeyError crashes)

**Impact**:

- Clean lint runs (no warnings)
- Robust briefing generation (graceful degradation for partial data)
- Zero breaking changes

**Why prioritize**: Maximum impact for minimal effort. Fixes immediate pain points.

---

### 2. update-ingestion-docs-typed-responses

**Priority**: High
**Effort**: Low (~3-4 hours)
**Validation**: ✅ Valid

**What**: Update ingestion operations runbook for typed HTTP response wrappers

- Replace old patterns (`response["key"]`) with new (`response.data["key"]`)
- Document JsonResponse, TextResponse, BytesResponse classes
- Add troubleshooting section for common errors
- Cross-reference to type safety docs

**Impact**:

- On-call engineers use correct patterns
- Aligned documentation reduces confusion
- Examples pass mypy --strict

**Why prioritize**: Complements recently completed `document-ingestion-typed-payloads` work. Documentation drift is causing confusion for engineers.

### 3. add-http-client-context-manager

**Priority**: Medium
**Effort**: Medium (~1-2 days)
**Validation**: ✅ Valid

**What**: Add async context manager protocol to AsyncHttpClient

- Implement `__aenter__` and `__aexit__` methods
- Refactor adapters to use `async with` pattern
- Add optional synchronous wrapper
- Prevent resource leaks

**Impact**:

- **Resource safety**: Guaranteed cleanup even on exceptions
- **Cleaner code**: Less boilerplate in adapters and tests
- **Fewer bugs**: Impossible to forget cleanup
- Backward compatible (old patterns still work)

**Why prioritize**: Standard Python idiom, prevents resource leaks that could cause production issues. Medium effort but high safety benefit.

### 4. stream-ndjson-batch-processing

**Priority**: Medium
**Effort**: Medium (~2-3 days)
**Validation**: ✅ Valid

**What**: Stream NDJSON batches instead of loading full files into memory

- Replace `list(_load_batch(...))` with iterator
- Add `IngestionPipeline.iter_results()` async iterator
- Add progress reporting for large batches
- Enable constant O(1) memory usage

**Impact**:

- **Scalability**: Handle millions of records without OOM
- **Faster feedback**: Streaming progress, not batch-wait
- **Better monitoring**: Per-document telemetry
- Memory: O(n) → O(1)

**Why prioritize**: Large-scale re-ingestion is common operational scenario. Current implementation causes OOM for 1M+ records.

## 📊 Priority Matrix

| Proposal | Impact | Effort | Priority | Status |
|----------|--------|--------|----------|--------|
| fix-ruff-config-defensive-formatting | High | Low | **Do First** | ✅ Valid |
| update-ingestion-docs-typed-responses | High | Low | **Do First** | ✅ Valid |
| add-http-client-context-manager | Medium | Medium | Do Next | ✅ Valid |
| stream-ndjson-batch-processing | Medium | Medium | Do Next | ✅ Valid |

## 🎯 Recommended Implementation Sequence

### Phase 1: Quick Wins (Week 1)

1. **fix-ruff-config-defensive-formatting** (2-3 hours)
2. **update-ingestion-docs-typed-responses** (3-4 hours)

**Rationale**: Low effort, high impact. Can be completed in 1 day.

### Phase 2: Safety & Performance (Week 2)

3. **add-http-client-context-manager** (1-2 days)
4. **stream-ndjson-batch-processing** (2-3 days)

**Rationale**: Medium effort improvements that prevent production issues.

## 📋 Recommendations NOT Converted to Proposals

Some recommendations were deferred for the following reasons:

### Deferred: Ledger Compaction

**Reason**: Not urgent. Current ledger sizes manageable. Consider when hitting performance issues.

**Future action**: Create proposal when ledger files exceed 100K entries.

### Deferred: Replace ConfigValidator with jsonschema

**Reason**: Working system. Refactoring risk > benefit currently.

**Future action**: Consider during next major config system refactor.

### Deferred: Custom Exceptions for Optional Dependencies

**Reason**: Nice-to-have, not critical. Current errors sufficient.

**Future action**: Bundle with next observability improvement work.

### Deferred: Clear Stale Metrics on Rollback

**Reason**: Edge case. Low occurrence in practice.

**Future action**: Address if metrics cardinality becomes issue.

### Deferred: Unify Ingestion CLIs

**Reason**: Larger refactor. Requires careful migration planning.

**Future action**: Create separate proposal after Phase 1-2 complete.

### Deferred: Document Lint/Type Overrides

**Reason**: Audit task, not implementation. Can be done alongside other work.

**Future action**: Create audit issue, address incrementally.

## 📞 Questions or Concerns

- **Why not unify ingestion CLIs?** Larger refactor, requires migration plan. Deferred to avoid scope creep.
- **Why not ledger compaction?** Not urgent, current sizes manageable. Will address when necessary.
- **Can Phase 1 & 2 overlap?** Yes, proposals are independent.
