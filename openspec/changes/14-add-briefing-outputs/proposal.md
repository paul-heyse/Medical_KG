# Add Briefing Outputs (Topic Dossiers, Evidence Maps, Interview Kits)

## Why

The primary use case is pre-engagement knowledge readiness: analysts need comprehensive, evidence-backed understanding of medical topics (therapy areas, devices, biomarkers) before participant interviews. Automated briefing generation from KG queries synthesizes PICO, endpoints, effect sizes, safety profiles, dosing, eligibility, and guideline stancesâ€”all with citations.

## What Changes

- Implement topic dossier generator (parameterized by topic: {condition, intervention, outcome}; produces PICO synopsis, endpoint effect sheet, safety profile with AEs+MedDRA+grade, dose guidance with UCUM, eligibility snapshot, guideline stance)
- Create evidence map builder (who found what, in which population, with certainty; linked to exact source spans)
- Implement interview kit generator (auto-propose questions on unresolved evidence, subpopulation effects, long-term safety, mechanism gaps)
- Add coverage report (list included studies, labels, guidelines, known gaps)
- Implement synthesis rules (aggregate effects across studies; detect conflicts; flag heterogeneity; prioritize high-certainty evidence)
- Create templates (Markdown, HTML, JSON) with citation management
- Add real-time Q&A mode (intent-aware retrieval + extraction + synthesis on-the-fly)

## Impact

- **Affected specs**: NEW `briefing-outputs` capability
- **Affected code**: NEW `/briefing/dossiers/`, `/briefing/evidence_maps/`, `/briefing/interview_kits/`, `/briefing/templates/`
- **Dependencies**: KG (query for studies, evidence, AEs, eligibility), Retrieval (augment with spans), Extraction (ensure all assertions span-grounded)
- **Downstream**: Analysts consume dossiers; interview kits used in participant prep; evidence maps for decision support
- **Quality**: 100% of asserted facts must carry citations (doc_id, start/end offsets, quotes)
