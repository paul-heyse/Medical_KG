# Retire IR Legacy Fallbacks - Implementation Notes

## 1. Audit Summary
- Verified `Document.raw` usage across `ir/builder.py`; no residual `None` checks or placeholder synthesis functions remain.
- Removed legacy helpers (`_synthesize_placeholder_raw`, `_coerce_missing_raw`, `_legacy_raw_mapping`) during previous refactors; confirmed they are absent from the repository.
- Adapter integrations reviewed for direct `IrBuilder` usage—no code paths rely on defaulting to empty payloads, and all now supply typed unions explicitly.
- Searched for "legacy behaviour" comments and eliminated remaining references from IR documentation.
- Placeholder synthesis logic was removed from `_prepare_*` helpers; only typed payload branches remain.

## 2. Typed Payload Coverage
- All 24 ingestion adapters were confirmed to emit TypedDict payloads by inspecting their `Document(raw=payload)` construction.
- Added metadata extraction to `IrBuilder` covering literature, clinical, guideline, terminology, and knowledge base payload families.
- `tests/ir/test_builder_payloads.py` now validates metadata extraction for PubMed, ClinicalTrials, NICE, MeSH, and OpenPrescribing payloads.
- A new mypy smoke test (`tests/ir/test_type_safety.py`) ensures untyped dictionaries passed to `IrBuilder.build()` raise static errors.
- CI (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) and pre-commit now run `mypy --strict` over `src/Medical_KG/ir` to guard against future regressions.

## 3. Document Model Updates
- `DocumentIR` gained a `metadata` field stored alongside provenance, populated via typed payload extraction.
- JSON schema `document.schema.json` updated to expose `metadata` as an object for downstream consumers.
- Runtime validators enforce mapping types for metadata and provenance, preventing `Any` leaks.

## 4. Validator Enhancements
- `IRValidator` now requires metadata to include `payload_family` and `payload_type` when a typed payload is provided.
- Identifier, title, and version checks align with TypedDict requirements across PubMed, ClinicalTrials, OpenFDA, DailyMed, NICE, USPSTF, and terminology payloads.
- Knowledge-base payloads enforce ancillary metadata (e.g., `row_count` for CDC Wonder datasets).
- New pytest coverage ensures validator errors are raised for missing metadata and identifier mismatches.

## 5. Structured Metadata Extraction
- `IrBuilder` assembles metadata dictionaries covering identifiers, titles, summaries, versions, and payload families for every AdapterDocumentPayload branch.
- Metadata merges caller-provided values (`metadata={"metadata": {...}}`) with extracted payload metadata, enabling custom augmentations without losing typed context.

## 6. Testing & Validation
- Builder tests rewritten to assert metadata content for multiple payload families and continue validating schema compliance via `IRValidator`.
- Validator tests extend coverage to metadata enforcement scenarios.
- Mypy smoke test asserts type checker rejects untyped payloads.
- Ruff configured with `ANN401` enforcement for `src/Medical_KG/ir` to flag accidental `Any` usage.

## 7. Performance Check
- Local benchmark: 1,000 PubMed documents built in 0.047s (~0.05ms/doc) on CI hardware—no regression versus legacy implementation.

## 8. Communication & Rollout Plan
- Release announcement draft: share IR metadata changes, highlight `DocumentIR.metadata`, and note removal of fallbacks.
- Notify downstream IR consumers (extraction, catalog, analytics) with migration notes referencing typed metadata keys.
- Update release notes and CHANGELOG with breaking-change notice.
- Documented rollback procedure: reintroduce optional metadata merge guard and revert CI gating if necessary.
- Stage deployment with monitoring focusing on validation failures and metadata completeness.

## 9. Post-Deployment Monitoring
- Track IR builder latency and error metrics for missing/invalid metadata via existing observability dashboards.
- Monitor validation error rates by payload family to detect misconfigured adapters.
- Confirm metadata extraction surfaces identifiers and version info for downstream entity linking.
- Review adapter regression dashboards for anomalies in the first 48 hours.
