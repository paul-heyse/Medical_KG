# Unified Ingestion CLI Design Review Summary

**Date:** 2025-03-04 (recorded asynchronously)

## Attendees
- Ingestion Engineering: Priya Shah, Mateo Alvarez
- Developer Experience: Lin Chen
- Operations: Morgan Ellis

## Agenda
1. Walk through flag harmonisation matrix and adapter validation UX.
2. Demo enhanced Typer help text and schema-validation option.
3. Confirm deprecation messaging + telemetry requirements.
4. Agree on migration tooling deliverables.

## Discussion Notes
- **Flag Mapping:** Stakeholders confirmed the mapping table covers every legacy/modern flag combination. Ops requested the additional `--schema` guardrail to catch malformed NDJSON before staging runs; now implemented with graceful fallback when `jsonschema` is absent.
- **Help & Docs:** DevEx validated the rich-markup help text (overview, examples, See also) and asked for per-adapter listing to remain dynamic via registry introspection. Output snapshot attached in `tests/ingestion/test_ingestion_cli.py` expectations.
- **Deprecation Experience:** Warning text reviewed; agreement to log delegate usage via `Medical_KG.cli` logger and surface suppression env var in docs.
- **Migration Tooling:** We committed to CI checker + command rewriting helper (`scripts/cli_migration/` directory) and a Slack/email template.

## Action Items
- [x] Land unified CLI with schema validation + updated help copy.
- [x] Ship migration helper scripts + documentation.
- [ ] Track adoption metrics post-release via logging dashboard (separate analytics task).
