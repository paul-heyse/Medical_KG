# Add Deployment Operations (Final Deployment Readiness)

## Why

Deployment readiness requires comprehensive operational runbooks, E2E verification, performance tuning, cost optimization, and disaster recovery procedures. This final capability ensures the system is 100% production-ready with observability, incident response, and continuous improvement processes.

## What Changes

- Create comprehensive runbooks (hot config change, scale operations, index rebuild, catalog refresh, GPU node failures, incident response)
- Implement E2E verification suite (full pipeline test: ingest → chunk → embed → index → retrieve → extract → KG write → briefing output)
- Add performance tuning guides (retrieval blend weights, OpenSearch shard sizing, Neo4j memory config, GPU batch tuning)
- Implement cost controls (TTL policies, ILM warm/cold tiers, spot GPU nodes, compression, budget alerts)
- Create load testing suite (burst 50 QPS, steady 10 QPS, mixed intents, P95 latency SLO verification)
- Add chaos testing scenarios (kill pods, drop network, fill disk, GPU OOM)
- Implement observability stack (Prometheus metrics, Grafana dashboards, OpenTelemetry tracing, structured logs)
- Create incident response playbook (severity definitions, escalation paths, on-call rotation, post-mortem template)
- Add operational metrics (pipeline throughput, indexing lag, GPU utilization, error rates, user-facing latency)
- Implement release checklist (sign-off: all metrics meet thresholds, no CPU fallback events, licenses validated, provenance 100%, SHACL pass ≥0.98, backups verified, rollback plan tested)

## Impact

- **Affected specs**: NEW `deployment-ops` capability
- **Affected code**: NEW `/ops/runbooks/`, `/ops/e2e/`, `/ops/chaos/`, `/ops/load_test/`, updates to monitoring configs
- **Dependencies**: All infrastructure (K8s, monitoring, backups); all services (for E2E testing)
- **Downstream**: Ops team uses runbooks for operations; release gates require sign-off checklist; incident playbook guides response
- **Readiness**: System 100% deployment-ready with operational procedures, monitoring, and incident response
