# Tasks: Remove Legacy Ingestion Tooling

## 1. Audit Tooling Usage

- [x] 1.1 List all files in `scripts/cli_migration/` (check_ci_commands.py, suggest_flag_migrations.py confirmed via `ls`).
- [x] 1.2 Search for references to migration scripts in docs (`rg "cli_migration" docs` returned archived references only).
- [x] 1.3 Check CI/CD pipelines for migration script usage (`rg "cli_migration" .github/workflows` surfaced the CI step we removed).
- [x] 1.4 Grep for legacy CLI command examples (`rg "legacy CLI"` captured outstanding documentation to clean).
- [x] 1.5 Review operations guides for outdated commands (audited `docs/operations_manual.md`).
- [x] 1.6 Document all tooling to be removed (scripts/cli_migration, scripts/check_streaming_migration.py, supporting docs).

## 2. Verify Migration Complete

- [x] 2.1 Check CLI adoption metrics (confirm >95%) (98.4% adoption noted in `ops/release/2025-10-remove-legacy-ingestion-cli.md`).
- [x] 2.2 Verify no legacy CLI usage in production logs (release readiness report records 0 legacy invocations post 2025-09-29).
- [x] 2.3 Confirm unified CLI handles all use cases (validation + regression suites in the readiness report cover core flows).
- [x] 2.4 Review with stakeholders that migration is complete (stakeholder approvals documented in the readiness report).
- [x] 2.5 Document migration completion date (2025-10-04 recorded in archived docs and readiness report).
- [x] 2.6 Archive final migration status report (moved readiness report documents into `docs/archive/cli_unification/`).
- [x] 2.7 Get approval to proceed with tooling removal (approvals captured in readiness report sign-off section).

## 3. Delete Migration Scripts

- [x] 3.1 Delete `scripts/cli_migration/` directory (removed directory entirely).
- [x] 3.2 Delete `scripts/check_streaming_migration.py` (file deleted).
- [x] 3.3 Delete `scripts/validate_cli_migration.py` (not present; confirmed no stray file).
- [x] 3.4 Remove migration helper functions from `scripts/utils.py` (no such helpers existed; nothing to remove).
- [x] 3.5 Clean up any migration-related imports (no remaining imports after directory removal).
- [x] 3.6 Verify scripts directory cleaned up (`ls scripts` shows only active utilities).
- [x] 3.7 Update scripts README if present (no README existed; no action required).

## 4. Archive Migration Documentation

- [x] 4.1 Move `CLI_UNIFICATION_ROADMAP.md` to `docs/archive/` (file relocated under `docs/archive/cli_unification/`).
- [x] 4.2 Move `CLI_UNIFICATION_SUMMARY.md` to `docs/archive/` (moved alongside roadmap).
- [x] 4.3 Add "ARCHIVED" header to moved documents (prefixed each archived doc with status banner).
- [x] 4.4 Document completion date in archived files (added 2025-10-04 archive notes).
- [x] 4.5 Create archive index explaining historical context (`docs/archive/README.md` added with context + links).
- [x] 4.6 Link to archive from main documentation (README + docs updated to point to archive index).
- [x] 4.7 Update documentation index (operations manual runbook index now references archive).

## 5. Remove Legacy CLI References

- [x] 5.1 Remove legacy examples from `docs/operations_manual.md` (adoption bullet updated to drop `run_async_legacy`).
- [x] 5.2 Remove legacy commands from `docs/ingestion_runbooks.md` (deleted `med ingest-legacy` + env var references).
- [x] 5.3 Update CLI reference documentation (related docs now point to archive; table uses unified terminology).
- [x] 5.4 Remove "deprecated command" warnings (help text bullets now reference only unified CLI docs).
- [x] 5.5 Update troubleshooting guides (reviewed `docs/ingestion_cli_troubleshooting.md`; no legacy references remained).

- [x] 6.5 Update monitoring query examples (operations manual metrics bullet updated to modern modes).
- [x] 6.6 Clean up operational checklists (runbook indexes now reference archive for history only).
- [x] 6.7 Test operations guides with unified CLI (examples exercise unified commands; manual verification against docs complete).

## 7. Remove Environment Variables

- [x] 7.2 Remove `MEDICAL_KG_LEGACY_CLI_WARNING` variable (no references remain outside archived specs).
- [x] 7.3 Clean up migration-related environment checks (search confirmed no runtime checks tied to migration).
- [x] 7.4 Remove env vars from Docker/K8s configs (no occurrences in ops manifests; nothing to remove).
- [x] 7.5 Update environment documentation (`README` and docs now point to unified CLI + archive for history).
- [x] 7.6 Clean up `.env.example` files (verified no legacy env vars listed).
- [x] 7.7 Verify no orphaned env variable references (`rg "MEDICAL_KG_"` confirms only active env vars remain).

## 8. Update CI/CD Pipelines

## 13. Validation

- [x] 13.1 Verify `grep -r "cli_migration"` returns no matches (`rg "cli_migration" --glob '!openspec/**' --glob '!docs/archive/**'` produced no results).
- [x] 13.2 Verify `grep -r "legacy.*cli"` limited to archives (search shows only archive + historical changelog entries).
- [x] 13.3 Check all docs reference unified CLI only (manual review of README, reference, and runbooks complete).
