## Why

Ingestion adapters (clinical, literature, guidelines, terminology) lack comprehensive test coverage. Current tests exist only for basic HTTP client and ledger functionality. Adapters handle complex data transformations, error recovery, rate limiting, and external API integrationâ€”all untested. This creates deployment risk and makes refactoring dangerous.

## What Changes

- Add unit tests for each adapter: `ClinicalTrialsAdapter`, `LiteratureAdapter` (PubMed, PMC, medRxiv), `GuidelinesAdapter`, `TerminologyAdapter` (UMLS, RxNorm, SNOMED).
- Mock external HTTP calls using `httpx.MockTransport` and provide canned responses for success, partial failure, rate limiting, and error cases.
- Test adapter-specific parsing logic: XML/JSON transformations, field extraction, metadata enrichment, and document construction.
- Test ingestion pipeline orchestration: registry lookup, adapter selection, ledger updates, and retry handling.
- Verify CLI commands (`ingest`, `resume`, `status`) with mocked dependencies.
- Achieve 100% coverage for `src/Medical_KG/ingestion/` excluding `__pycache__`.

## Impact

- Affected specs: `testing` (MODIFIED: Subsystem Test Depth to include ingestion coverage requirements)
- Affected code: `tests/ingestion/`, `src/Medical_KG/ingestion/adapters/`, `src/Medical_KG/ingestion/cli.py`, `tests/conftest.py` (new fixtures)
- Risks: mocking external APIs may not catch real integration issues; mitigation via separate E2E smoke tests with live endpoints (out of scope here).
