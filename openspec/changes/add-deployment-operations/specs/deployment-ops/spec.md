## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Operational Runbooks
The platform SHALL publish and maintain runbooks for core operational procedures including configuration reloads, retrieval scaling, index rebuilds, catalog refresh, GPU/vLLM recovery, data store failover, and incident response.

#### Scenario: Hot configuration change
- **WHEN** an operator needs to roll out a config change
- **THEN** the runbook SHALL document authentication, `/admin/reload` invocation, verification via `/version`, and metrics checks

#### Scenario: Retrieval scaling
- **WHEN** traffic exceeds configured thresholds
- **THEN** the runbook SHALL provide HPA, KEDA, and manual scaling guidance with rollback steps

#### Scenario: Incident response
- **WHEN** an outage or SLO breach occurs
- **THEN** the incident handbook SHALL define severity levels, escalation paths, communication templates, and post-mortem process

### Requirement: E2E Verification Suite
The system SHALL provide automated end-to-end verification that exercises ingest→chunk→facet→embed→index→retrieve→extract→briefing flows and validates SLAs.

#### Scenario: Nightly regression
- **WHEN** nightly verification runs
- **THEN** it SHALL ingest fixture corpora, run full pipeline, assert schema compliance, and emit latency & quality reports

### Requirement: Load & Performance Testing
The platform SHALL maintain load testing profiles with defined intent mixes, SLO budgets, and reporting outputs.

#### Scenario: Burst workload
- **WHEN** the burst profile runs (≥50 QPS)
- **THEN** reports SHALL capture latency percentiles, error rate, resource utilization, and SLO compliance

### Requirement: Chaos & Resilience Drills
The platform SHALL support planned chaos experiments covering pod failures, network partitions, disk pressure, and accelerator faults with automated recovery checks.

#### Scenario: GPU OOM drill
- **WHEN** a GPU OOM chaos scenario executes
- **THEN** jobs SHALL fail gracefully, alerts SHALL fire, and recovery steps SHALL be validated within documented targets

### Requirement: Observability Standards
The platform SHALL expose metrics, tracing, and structured logs with alert thresholds covering API latency, pipeline failures, cluster health, and evaluation regressions.

#### Scenario: API latency alert
- **WHEN** P95 `/retrieve` latency exceeds 900ms for 5 minutes
- **THEN** Prometheus SHALL trigger a critical alert with runbook reference

### Requirement: Release Readiness Gate
Releases SHALL pass a documented checklist covering metrics, licensing, backups, rollback validation, and stakeholder sign-off before promotion.

#### Scenario: Release approval
- **WHEN** a deployment candidate is prepared
- **THEN** the checklist SHALL confirm metrics within targets, licenses validated, backups tested, rollback rehearsed, and approvals recorded

### Requirement: Cost & Capacity Policies
The platform SHALL define data retention, ILM tiering, GPU/compute optimization, and budget alerts to manage operational costs.

#### Scenario: Storage lifecycle
- **WHEN** transient data exceeds TTL
- **THEN** policies SHALL purge or tier data automatically per documented retention schedule

### Requirement: Documentation & Continuous Improvement
Operations documentation SHALL include deployment guide, operations manual, and cadence for metrics review, DR drills, and security audits.

#### Scenario: Quarterly DR drill
- **WHEN** the quarterly DR drill occurs
- **THEN** the documentation SHALL outline restore steps, success criteria, and capture lessons for follow-up actions
